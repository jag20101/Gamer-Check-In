	Gamer Check-in is an app that allows the user to "check-in" to 
	whatever game they are usuing, regardless of the gaming network.
	It plans to remove the annoyance of having your friends only 
	see you playing a certain game on a certain network, so if,
	for example, I were playing on Steam, and my friends were
	playing Xbox, we would never know what one another
	was playing and whether or not we wanted to play with them,
	unless we had some other, centralized form of communication.
	This is what Gamer Check-in prides itself upon, seamless
	integration between the networks, so at the click of a button,
	your friends know exactly what game and on which network you
	are playing, so you may play together.
